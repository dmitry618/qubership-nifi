# User Guide

Apache NiFi is scalable and configurable dataflow platform.
Sections below describe usage of additional components present only in qubership-nifi.
Refer to Apache NiFi [User Guide](https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/user-guide.html) for basic usage.

## Additional processors

Qubership-nifi contains additional processors compared with Apache NiFi.
Table below provides list of these processors with descriptions.
More information on their usage is available in Help (`Global Menu` -> `Help`) within qubership-nifi.

<!-- Table for additional processors. DO NOT REMOVE. -->

| Processor  | NAR                 | Description        |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| QueryDatabaseToJsonWithMerge | migration-nifi-processors-open | Executes custom query to fetch rows from table and merge them with the main JSON object which is in the content of incoming FlowFile.  The Path property supports JsonPath syntax to find source ID attributes in the main object.  The main and queried objects are merged by join key properties.You can specify where exactly to insert queried objects and by what key with path  to insert and key to insert properties. |
| QueryDatabaseToJson | migration-nifi-processors-open | Fetches data from database table and transforms it to JSON.This processor gets incoming FlowFile and reads ID attributes using JSON Path. Found IDs are passedin select query as an array. Obtained result set will be written into output FlowFile.Expects that content of an incoming FlowFile is array of unique business entity identifiers in the JSON format. |
| FetchTableToJson | migration-nifi-processors-open | Fetches data from DB table into JSON using either query (Custom Query) or table (Table) and  list of columns (Columns To Return). This processor works in batched mode: it collects FlowFiles until  batch size limit is reached and then processes batch. This processor can accept incoming connections;  the behavior of the processor is different whether incoming connections are provided: -If no incoming connection(s) are specified, the processor will generate SQL queries on the specified  processor schedule. -If incoming connection(s) are specified and no FlowFile is available to a processor task, no work will be performed. -If incoming connection(s) are specified and a FlowFile is available to a processor task, query  will be executed when processing the next FlowFile. |
| ValidateJson | migration-nifi-processors-open | Validates the content of FlowFiles against the JSON schema. The FlowFiles that are successfully validated against the specified schema are routed to valid relationship without any changes. The FlowFiles that are not valid according to the schema are routed to invalid relationship. Array with validation errors is added to the content of FlowFile. |
| BackupAttributes | migration-nifi-processors-open | Backups all FlowFile attributes by adding prefix to their names. |
| PutGeneratedRecord | migration-nifi-processors-open | A processor that generates Records based on its properties and sends them to a destination specified by a Record Destination Service (i.e., record sink). The record source is defined by the 'Source Type' property, which can be either 'Dynamic Properties' or 'JSON Property'. If 'Source Type' is set to 'Dynamic Properties', each dynamic property becomes a field in the Record, with the field type automatically determined by the value type: string, double, or Record (if the dynamic property contains a JSON value and is listed in the 'List JSON Dynamic Property' property). If 'Source Type' is set to 'JSON Property', the Record is generated directly from the JSON value in the 'JSON Property'. |
| QueryDatabaseToCSV | migration-nifi-processors-open | Fetches data from DB using specified query and transforms it to CSV in particular CSV format.The processor allows to split query result into several FlowFiles and select CSV format for output. |
| PutSQLRecord | qubership-nifi-db-processors-nar | Executes given SQL statement using data from input records. All records within single  FlowFile are processed within single transaction. |
| PostgreSQLBulkLoader | qubership-nifi-db-processors-nar | The processor supports copying from stdin using the incoming content of the Flow File or a file accessible by path.It is also possible to copy from DB to FlowFile content. |
