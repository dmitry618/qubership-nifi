# qubership-nifi-tools-nifi-common

A reusable Apache NiFi 1.x and 2.x REST client for command-line tools. It provides TLS setup,
authentication, bounded HTTP transport, URI resolution, version detection, and component catalogs.
The library uses Apache HttpClient 5 and Jackson without constraining caller configuration or output.

## Maven coordinates

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.qubership.nifi</groupId>
    <artifactId>qubership-nifi-tools-nifi-common</artifactId>
    <version>${qubership-nifi.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Requires Java 21.

## Packages

| Package | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `...nifi.common.tls` | `TlsContextFactory` builds an `SSLContext` from optional client key material (`Pkcs12KeyMaterial`) and optional trust material (`PemTrustMaterial`, `Pkcs12TrustMaterial`). Unusable material raises `TlsMaterialException`. |
| `...nifi.common.auth` | `NiFiRequestAuthenticator` and its three implementations: `BearerTokenAuthenticator`, `AuthorizationBearerCookieAuthenticator`, and `NoAuthentication` for mutual TLS or unauthenticated endpoints. |
| `...nifi.common.http` | `NiFiUriResolver` normalizes the deployment URL and resolves paths against it. `NiFiHttpClient` is the bounded transport, `NiFiRestClient` the JSON layer over it, `NiFiHttpResponse` the result, and `NiFiApiException` the failure. |
| `...nifi.common.api` | `NiFiAboutClient` and `NiFiVersion` for version detection, `NiFiComponentCatalogClient` and `NiFiComponentKind` for type lists, component definitions, and additional details. |

## Library usage

```java
NiFiUriResolver resolver = NiFiUriResolver.fromBaseUrl("https://nifi.example.com/nifi");
SSLContext sslContext = TlsContextFactory.create(
        Optional.empty(), Optional.of(PemTrustMaterial.fromFile(Path.of("ca.pem"))));
NiFiRequestAuthenticator auth = new BearerTokenAuthenticator(token);

NiFiHttpClient http = new NiFiHttpClient(
        NiFiHttpClient.newHttpClient(sslContext, Duration.ofSeconds(30)), resolver, auth);
try (NiFiRestClient rest = new NiFiRestClient(http, new ObjectMapper())) {
    String version = new NiFiAboutClient(rest, resolver).readVersionString();

    NiFiComponentCatalogClient catalog = new NiFiComponentCatalogClient(rest, resolver);
    for (JsonNode type : catalog.listTypes(NiFiComponentKind.PROCESSOR)) {
        JsonNode definition = catalog.getDefinition(NiFiComponentKind.PROCESSOR,
                type.path("bundle").path("group").asText(),
                type.path("bundle").path("artifact").asText(),
                type.path("bundle").path("version").asText(),
                type.path("type").asText());
    }
}
```

`NiFiRestClient` and `NiFiHttpClient` own the underlying Apache client and its connection pool.
Close one of them when the work is done.

`Pkcs12KeyMaterial` and `Pkcs12TrustMaterial` copy their password arrays. Call `clearPassword()` in
a `finally` block after `TlsContextFactory.create` returns or fails. The caller remains responsible
for clearing the password array supplied to the material object.

`NiFiUriResolver.fromBaseUrl` requires HTTPS by default; the two-argument overload relaxes that for
a test server. It accepts either the deployment URL or the browser UI URL, stripping a trailing
`/nifi` or `/nifi-api` so both normalize to the same base, and it preserves a reverse-proxy path
prefix.

## What the transport guarantees

- **Same origin.** Every request URI is checked against the resolver's scheme, host, and port, and
  so is every redirect hop. A redirect off the origin is refused rather than followed.
- **No automatic redirects.** Redirects are followed only by this library's own loop, up to the
  configured budget.
- **Bounded responses.** A body over `maxBodyBytes` fails the exchange instead of being buffered.
- **Retries only where they are safe.** GET is retried on 429, 502, 503, and 504 and on transport
  failures, with exponential backoff capped by `maxBackoff` and honoring `Retry-After`. POST and
  DELETE are never retried.
- **Diagnostics without secrets.** `NiFiApiException` carries the method, a redacted URI, the status
  code, and a bounded single-line body excerpt. Authenticators redact their credentials in
  `toString()`.

All of the bounds live in `NiFiHttpClient.Config`; `Config.defaults()` is a 60-second request
timeout, a 32 MB body limit, three retries, and three redirects.

## Limitations

- **Synchronous only.** Every call blocks the calling thread. There is no async or reactive surface.
- **One origin per client.** A `NiFiHttpClient` is bound to the origin of the resolver it was built
  with. Talking to two NiFi instances means two clients.
- **NiFi 2.x endpoint paths.** `NiFiComponentKind` and `NiFiAboutClient` hardcode the NiFi 2.x
  `/nifi-api/flow/...` paths.
- **The request timeout is per socket read,** not a deadline for the whole response. A response that
  keeps trickling bytes can outlast it.

## Static metadata providers and temporary ownership

`NiFiComponentReference` identifies a component by kind, type, and exact bundle coordinates.
`NiFi2xComponentMetadataProvider` returns native definitions. `NiFi1xComponentMetadataProvider`
returns normalized metadata through an `AutoCloseable` `NiFiTemporaryComponentSession`.

For each exact bundle coordinate, the NiFi 1.x session creates processors and process-group-scoped
controller services in a temporary child group. Reporting tasks always use controller scope, and a
controller service uses it only when the caller passes `true` to `collect(reference, controllerScope)`.
The session removes each component after collection. Close it before
publishing output. Component creation can invoke extension initialization even when the component
is never enabled or scheduled, so use disposable targets.

The session logs its run marker, resource IDs, and endpoints, and logs each cleanup failure at ERROR
when it occurs. It reconciles uncertain creation by
exact ownership and throws `NiFiCleanupException` if cleanup fails. Callers must treat cleanup
failures as fatal. If collection and cleanup both fail, the cleanup failure is suppressed on the
collection failure. After a cleanup or group-creation failure, later `collect` calls fail without
sending a request.

Descriptors are returned as the instance reports them. The `allowableValues` of a controller-service
reference property therefore list the service instances visible from the temporary group; remove
them where only static metadata is wanted.

`NiFiRestClient.delete` propagates non-success statuses. For a stale revision, the session verifies
ownership and the current revision with GET before one DELETE retry. It also confirms a 404 with GET;
other statuses, including 409, fail cleanup. Transport-level POST and DELETE retries and redirects
remain disabled.

The bounded GET overload accepts a URI predicate that restricts documentation redirects to a
component subtree. `resolveCoordinatePath` encodes bundle coordinates and trailing documentation
segments while preserving deployment prefixes.
