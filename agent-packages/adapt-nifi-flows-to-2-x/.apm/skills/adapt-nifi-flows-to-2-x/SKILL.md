  Use this skill to automatically apply NiFi 1.x to 2.x upgrade recommendations produced by the
  [upgradeAdvisor](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-nifi/tree/main/dev/upgrade-advisor) script.
---

# Apply Upgrade Advisor Recommendations

## Prerequisites

1. Python >= 3.10

## Inputs

Accept as positional args: `/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x [csv_path] [exports_dir]`

If either argument is missing:

- For `csv_path`: use Glob to find `**/upgradeAdvisorReport.csv` in the workspace.
- For `exports_dir`: once the CSV is found, run:

  ```bash
  python3 .claude/skills/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x/scripts/upgrade_nifi_lib.py \
    --detect-exports-dir <csv_path>
  ```

  Use the printed value as `exports_dir`. Do **not** derive `exports_dir` from the location
  of JSON files - it must be derived from the CSV's `Flow name` values, which encode the
  path relative to the correct exports root.

If either path was discovered automatically, use AskUserQuestion tool to confirm both paths with the user before
proceeding.

Once `exports_dir` is confirmed, detect the source NiFi version:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x/scripts/detect_nifi_version.py \
  <exports_dir>
```

- **Exit 0, one version printed**: use it directly as `NIFI_SOURCE_VERSION`.
- **Exit 0, multiple versions printed**: use AskUserQuestion to ask which version to use, listing all options.
- **Exit 1** (no `org.apache.nifi` bundles found): use AskUserQuestion to ask the user to supply the source NiFi
  version.

Report the resolved `NIFI_SOURCE_VERSION` to the user before continuing.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Create tmp directory

1. Create repo-local `tmp/` directory if not exists.
2. Add it to `.gitignore` if not present already.
3. Remove existing `tmp/upgrade_nifi_run.py` if exists, to avoid confusion with the new one that will be generated in
   Step 3.

Log the changes that were made.

### Step 2a - Collect data

Run both commands and show the full output to the user:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x/scripts/upgrade_nifi_lib.py \
  --collect-vars <csv_path> <exports_dir>
```

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x/scripts/upgrade_nifi_lib.py \
  --analyze <csv_path> <exports_dir>
```

- `--collect-vars` outputs a JSON object mapping each variable name to its occurrences
  (file path, PG name/UUID, value, reference count within the PG subtree) and a
  `values_differ` flag.
- `--analyze` summarises every CSV row as AUTO, AI Agent, CONTEXT PLAN, or MANUAL. AUTO rows include the processor name
  and UUID - use these directly in subsequent steps; do not re-discover UUIDs by searching flow JSON files.
  At the end of its output `--analyze` also prints an `=== Issue Flags ===` JSON block - use these boolean flags
  to decide which reference files to open in Step 2b.

### Step 2b - Prepare upgrade decision plan

1. If the `--analyze` output contains any `[CONTEXT PLAN]` rows, **or** if the JSON produced by `--collect-vars` is not
   empty (variables present in the flow but not flagged by the advisor), open and follow
   `.claude/skills/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x/references/parameter-context-planning.md`.
2. If `NIFI_SOURCE_VERSION < 1.28.1` **and** the issue flags show `"prometheus": true`,
   open and follow `.claude/skills/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x/references/prometheus-record-sink-analysis.md`.
3. If the issue flags show `"proxy": true`,
   open and follow `.claude/skills/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x/references/proxy-properties-handling.md`.
4. If the issue flags show `"aws": true`,
   open and follow `.claude/skills/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x/references/aws-components-analysis.md`.
5. **Cross-file gate (mandatory check, not a conditional skip):** Before leaving Step 2b, re-read the
   placement answers from sub-items 3 and 4 above. For every InvokeHTTP or S3 processor whose chosen
   Controller Service location is a *different file* than the processor's own file, an entry MUST
   be added to `INVOKEHTTP_CROSS_FILE` or `S3_CROSS_FILE`. If even one such entry exists, you MUST open
   and follow `.claude/skills/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x/references/cross-file-parameter-context.md` to
   build `PARENT_CONTEXT_PLAN`. Skipping this step produces warnings of the form
   `[WARN] context '<name>' not found in any file under <exports_dir>` and a broken parent PG that
   does not resolve `#{param}` references at runtime. Do not proceed to Step 2c until
   `PARENT_CONTEXT_PLAN` is built or you have explicitly confirmed both cross-file dicts are empty.
6. Ensure all user questions from the applicable reference files have complete answers before proceeding to Step 3.

### Step 2c - Detect standalone controller services requiring rename

Run:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x/scripts/upgrade_nifi_lib.py \
  --detect-standalone-cs <csv_path> <exports_dir>
```

- If the output is `[]`, skip this step - no standalone CS renames needed.
- If non-empty: for each entry, present the current file path, current service name, current type,
  suggested new service name, and suggested new filename to the user.
  Use AskUserQuestion to ask the user to confirm or adjust each suggested name and filename.
  Record the confirmed values for Step 3.

### Step 3 - Generate the run script

**Precondition check (do this before writing any code):**

- If `INVOKEHTTP_CROSS_FILE` or `S3_CROSS_FILE` contains any entries, `PARENT_CONTEXT_PLAN` MUST be
  populated from a completed walkthrough of `cross-file-parameter-context.md`. A non-empty cross-file
  dict combined with an empty or hand-rolled `PARENT_CONTEXT_PLAN` is a bug - go back to Step 2b
  sub-item #5 and complete it before generating the script.

Based on the analysis and user answers from Step 2b, generate `tmp/upgrade_nifi_run.py`:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '.claude/skills/adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x/scripts')
from fixes    import apply_csv_transforms, rename_standalone_controller_services
from contexts import apply_variable_contexts, apply_hardcoded_values, apply_parent_contexts

CSV_PATH    = "<abs_path_to_csv>"
EXPORTS_DIR = "<abs_path_to_exports_dir>"

# PARAMETER_CONTEXT_PLAN - built from the AI analysis and user answers in Step 2b.
# Each entry: name, parent (or None), parameters dict, apply_to list of (rel_path, pg_uuid).
PARAMETER_CONTEXT_PLAN = [
    {
        "name": "common-params",
        "parent": None,
        "parameters": {
            # ... common variables here ...
        },
        "apply_to": [
            # ("relative/path/to/flow.json", "process-group-uuid"),
        ],
    },
    # ... child contexts ...
]

# HARDCODE_PLAN - variables excluded from parameterisation (values_differ: true and
# the user chose hardcoding over per-flow contexts). One entry per PG per variable.
HARDCODE_PLAN = [
    # {
    #     "variable": "processing.var2",
    #     "value":    "EntityType1",
    #     "rel_path": "relative/path/to/flow.json",
    #     "pg_uuid":  "process-group-uuid",
    # },
]

# Detected (or user-confirmed) source NiFi version - used for new Apache NiFi bundle versions.
NIFI_SOURCE_VERSION = "<detected_version>"

# Empty dict = use defaults (NiFi >= 1.28.1).
# For older NiFi, fill with user-confirmed values:
#   {"new_type": "...", "new_bundle": {...}, "prop_map": {...}}
PROMETHEUS_UPGRADE_PARAMS = {}

# Only needed when a StandardProxyConfigurationService should live in a different file
# than the InvokeHTTP processor. Keyed by processor UUID (from --analyze output).
# Leave as {} if the CS should be created in the same file as the processor.
INVOKEHTTP_CROSS_FILE = {
    # "<invokehttp-processor-uuid>": {
    #     "group_key":      "<any-unique-string-for-deduplication>",
    #     "parent_pg_path": "<exports_dir>/relative/path/to/parent.json",
    #     "child_pg_path":  "<exports_dir>/relative/path/to/child.json",
    # },
}

# Same structure as INVOKEHTTP_CROSS_FILE, for AWSCredentialsProviderControllerService.
# Leave as {} if the CS should be in the same file as the S3 processor.
S3_CROSS_FILE = {
    # "<s3-processor-uuid>": {
    #     "group_key":      "<any-unique-string-for-deduplication>",
    #     "parent_pg_path": "<exports_dir>/relative/path/to/parent.json",
    #     "child_pg_path":  "<exports_dir>/relative/path/to/child.json",
    # },
}

# Standalone CS renames - populated from confirmed values in Step 2c.
# Leave as [] if Step 2c found nothing or was skipped.
# Renames run AFTER apply_csv_transforms so CSV-based file lookups still resolve.
STANDALONE_CS_RENAMES = [
    # {
    #     "file":     "relative/path/to/old_file.json",
    #     "new_name": "New Service Name",
    #     "new_file": "relative/path/to/new_file.json",
    # },
]

# Parent PG parameter context assignment - populated from cross-file-parameter-context.md.
# Leave as [] when INVOKEHTTP_CROSS_FILE and S3_CROSS_FILE are both {}.
PARENT_CONTEXT_PLAN = [
    # assign_direct: parent PG has no context, one child context covers all needed params
    # {
    #     "action":          "assign_direct",
    #     "parent_pg_file":  "relative/path/to/parent.json",  # relative to EXPORTS_DIR
    #     "needed_contexts": ["child-ctx-name"],
    # },
    #
    # create_wrapper: parent PG has no context, multiple child contexts needed
    # {
    #     "action":          "create_wrapper",
    #     "parent_pg_file":  "relative/path/to/parent.json",
    #     "needed_contexts": ["child-ctx-1", "child-ctx-2"],
    #     "wrapper_name":    "user-confirmed-wrapper-name",
    # },
    #
    # add_inheritance: parent PG already has a context, extend it with missing inherits
    # {
    #     "action":                "add_inheritance",
    #     "parent_pg_file":        "relative/path/to/parent.json",
    #     "needed_contexts":       ["missing-ctx-name"],
    #     "existing_context_name": "already-assigned-ctx-name",
    # },
]

apply_csv_transforms(
    CSV_PATH, EXPORTS_DIR,
    nifi_version=NIFI_SOURCE_VERSION,
    prometheus_params=PROMETHEUS_UPGRADE_PARAMS,
    invokehttp_cross_file=INVOKEHTTP_CROSS_FILE or None,
    s3_cross_file=S3_CROSS_FILE or None,
)
apply_variable_contexts(EXPORTS_DIR, PARAMETER_CONTEXT_PLAN)
apply_hardcoded_values(EXPORTS_DIR, HARDCODE_PLAN)
apply_parent_contexts(EXPORTS_DIR, PARENT_CONTEXT_PLAN)
rename_standalone_controller_services(EXPORTS_DIR, STANDALONE_CS_RENAMES)
```

**Show the generated script to the user for a final review** before running it.
Ask them to confirm or adjust anything.

### Step 4 - Run on approval

```bash
python3 tmp/upgrade_nifi_run.py
```

Show the full output to the user.

### Step 5 - Script engine translation (ExecuteScript processors)

For each row in the CSV where `Issue` contains `Script Engine = python/ruby/lua`:

1. Read the processor's `Script Body` property from the modified flow JSON (use the Read tool)
2. Translate the script body from its original language to Groovy:
    - Preserve logic and variable names as closely as possible
    - Use NiFi Groovy globals: `session`, `flowFile`, `log`, `context`
    - FlowFile operations: `session.get()`, `session.write()`, `session.putAttribute()`,
      `session.transfer(ff, REL_SUCCESS)`, `session.transfer(ff, REL_FAILURE)`
    - If translation is uncertain, emit a Groovy stub with the original in a comment block
3. Update the processor in the JSON via Edit tool:
    - Set `Script Engine` = `"Groovy"`
    - Set `Script Body` to:

      ```groovy
      // Auto-translated from <language> by adapt-nifi-flows-to-2-x. Review before use.
      <translated Groovy code>

      // ── Original <language> preserved below ──
      /*
      <original script body>
      */
      ```

### Step 6 - Adapt other repository files

1. Run the command below to enumerate candidate files (substituting the actual `exports_dir` and `csv_path` values).
   Only read files that appear in the output.

   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import subprocess, os
   exports_rel = os.path.relpath('<exports_dir>')
   csv_rel     = os.path.relpath('<csv_path>')
   skip_pfx = [
       'tmp' + os.sep,
       '.claude' + os.sep,
       '.agents' + os.sep,
       '.git' + os.sep,
       exports_rel + os.sep,
   ]
   skip_dirs = {'target'}
   files = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'ls-files']).decode().splitlines()
   for f in files:
       norm = f.replace('/', os.sep)
       if norm == csv_rel:
           continue
       if any(norm.startswith(p) for p in skip_pfx):
           continue
       if skip_dirs.intersection(norm.split(os.sep)[:-1]):
           continue
       print(f)
   "
   ```

2. For each remaining file, check whether the changes from steps 4-5 require a corresponding update - for example:
   adding new controller service to an enable-list, a renamed property referenced in config, a parameterised variable
   mentioned in configuration or documentation file. If in doubt, propose the change and ask the user to confirm before
   applying it.

### Step 7 - Report

Summarise:

- Files modified and what changed in each
- Manual action items (from script output + any items you could not automate)

## Notes

- The library never overwrites a file unless it was actually modified.
- JSON files are written with `indent=4`, key order preserved.
- If a processor UUID from the CSV is not found in the flow JSON, a `[WARN]` is logged and
  the row is skipped (does not abort the run).
- `apply_variable_contexts` replaces `${varName}` with `#{varName}` **only** for variable names
  that are part of the parameter context plan for the given PG (including inherited parameters
  from parent contexts). FlowFile attribute expressions like `${filename}` or `${uuid()}` are
  left untouched.
- `apply_hardcoded_values` replaces `${varName}` with the literal string value directly in
  processor/service properties. Use for variables with `values_differ: true` when the user
  prefers hardcoding over per-flow parameter contexts. Each flow file is loaded once even
  when multiple variables in the same file are hardcoded.
